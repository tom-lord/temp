#### Com Laude / Valideus

I was employed by [Com Laude](https://comlaude.com/) from October 2014 - March 2017.

In this time, I designed/created/maintained a variety of tools and websites,
ranging from small Proof of Concepts/Minimal Viable Products to relatively large
applications (approx 50,000 total users).
Most of the "interesting" projects unfortunately require a login, but I have provided some screenshots below:

* [TLD Validation System](https://validations.valideus.com) (private; requires login)
