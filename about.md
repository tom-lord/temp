### Recent Work

I have primarily been focused on designing/creating/maintaining a variety of websites over the past few years.
Most of the "interesting" projects unfortunately require a login; I will add some
screenshots to this page when I get round to it...

* [TLD Validation System](https://validations.valideus.com) (private; requires login)
* [Domains Watch](https://domains.watch) (partially public; free to sign-up)
* [GTLD Dashboard](http://gtld-dashboard.com) (private; requires login)
* TLD "nic" (Network Information Center) pages (fully public) - such as:
  * [nic.hsbc](http://nic.hsbc)
